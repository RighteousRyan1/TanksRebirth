## Additions



## Changes

- AI Tanks are now completely overhauled! They now behave much different from how they did before
	- They almost never kill themselves
	- Almost never shoot themselves
	- Act 10x more similar to the original game
	- Should, overall, make them less of a nuisance to destroy
	- Should also improve their random movements a ton
- Yellow tank music is now prioritized over pink tank music
- Reworked Co-op spawn positions on most Vanilla campaign levels
- Reworked a few missions, and buffed the final mission slightly

## Changes Important for Modders

- Completely overhauled the AI Parameters.
	- Be sure to read the documentation of them by hovering on them in your IDE!
- Pink tanks, internally, are now listed before Yellow tanks

## Fixes

- Fixed needing a "Starting Lives" value to save a specific mission
- Changed some inconsistencies between the original missions and Rebirth's

## TODO

- [ ] New AI tank aggression system (depending on the tank type, will either make advances towards you or will avoid you)
