Remember you can enable speedrun mode with `F1`! Top 5 uploaded speedruns will get their spot on the main menu!

# Additions

- Made the game take advantage of multiple threads! If your CPU has multiple threads (hopefully it does), the game should now run better under higher workloads, and just overall better.
- Added slight pitch shifting in many game-related sound effects

# Changes

- Increased the maximum tank count to 60

# Changes Important for Modders

- Don't create, modify, or generate textures in AI-related tank logic code now! It will throw an exception as it won't be the main thread

# Fixes

- Fixed nametags showing for non-host clients after the game has started if the host started the game with the client being in the multiplayer menu
- Fixed smokes generated from smoke grenades being the wrong color

# TODO

- [ ] Multithreaded tank AI
- [ ] Campaign fail/success display
- [ ] Tank tread hyper-optimization (and visual re-haul)
- [ ] Wiimote support
- [ ] Real-time multiplayer stats
- [ ] Fix campaigns not ending immediately on all clients

PLEASE, if you find anything wrong, go to my [discord](https://discord.gg/KhfzvbrrKx) server and report bugs in the #bugs 
channel, or, if you want to suggest something, suggest them in the #suggestions channel.

Happy tanking!
