##### TODO: multiplayer stats (press tab n stuff to see other player kill counts, also have kills be per-player)
##### ALSO: make ping tab vertical (maybe)
##### ALSO: fix campaign not ending until another attempt passes

Remember you can enable speedrun mode with `F1`! Top 5 uploaded (may be changed later) speedruns will get their spot on the main menu!

## Additions

- Added an entire room that the entire game scene exists in! There is no longer a black void that consumes the game
	- There's even a cool grandfather clock that matches your system's clock time!
- Added "Tactical Planes" mode where old "Marble Mod Buff" was
- Added some handy-dandy FPS graphs at the user's disposal, if needed
- Added scores for every player in the game
- Added 'Total terrain' info to the Level Info bar within the level editor
- Added the long-awaited cursor trail!
- Added a button to the campaigns menu instead of the user having to press Enter to download the latest version
- Added the ability for the game to obtain hardware information on any OS (MacOS, Linux) instead of only Windows
- Added the bonus life animation after over 3.5 years!

## Changes

- All tank types above "obsidian" are now gone.
	- This is because they were poorly designed, and will benefit more being replaced by the tanks to come in the future!
- "Master Mod Buff" changed to "Master Mode"
- Changed the game's main font (for english only)
- Players can no longer *visually* peek through corners of map geometry
- Blocks are now slightly bigger
- Main menu animation is now much different
- MOTD is now just plastered on the top of the screen
- Adjusted the look of the mission title bar / background
- UI tooltips no longer go off-screen
- Revamped the multiplayer UI
- Player scoreboards have been changed in color and look
- "東方 Mode" changed to "Bullet Hell"
- Window title has been changed to "Tanks! Rebirth"
- LARGELY improved the mission intermission look, which looks about 99.9% accurate now (validate the campaign version in the campaigns menu!!!)
- The chat now appears over the intermission screen
- The intermission screen background no longer scrolls when paused/stopped
- You now have to middle click instead of right click to delete a campaign, which makes mistakes much less likely
- Somewhat modified the campaigns menu look, so buttons don't overflow
- Having a controller plugged in no longer prevents keyboard usage for gameplay

## Changes Important for Modders

- `GameProperties` -> `CampaignGlobals`
- `TanksRebirth.GameContent.Properties` -> `TanksRebirth.GameContent.Globals`
- Almost every asset is now stored in a more general folder
    - General-purpose models are now under `models`
    - All music is now in `music` or a subfolder under `music`
- `RotatedByRadians` -> `Rotate`
- `TankID.Random` has been purged, for good reasons
- Lots of camera-related things from `TankGame` are now located in `CameraGlobals`
	- This includes `GameView` and `GameProjection`, important matrices to include with custom 3D rendering involving gameplay
- `GamepadBind` and `Keybind` now are `IInputBind<T>`s, which means you can use use them modularly within your code
- When changing tank models, be sure to set `UsesCustomModel` to `true`
- Assets (only models, for now) are managed via `Resource<Model>`s within `ModelResources`.
- Particles now rotate on the proper Yaw-Pitch-Roll axes, conversion:
	- Old Yaw -> Roll
	- Old Pitch -> Yaw
	- Old Roll -> Pitch
- `TankGame.PostDraw` -> `TankGame.PostDrawEverything`
- Numerous rendering-related things are now stored in `RenderGlobals`
- Many things from `TankGame` (such as frame time, delta time, etc) have been moved to `RuntimeData`
- `TankGame.TextFont`/`TextFontLarge` -> `FontGlobals.RebirthFont`/`RebirthFontLarge`
- `GameHandler.GameRand` -> `Client.ClientRandom`
- AI tank properties and parameters can now be fetched separately inside of AIManager
- `Armor` -> `TankArmor`
- `TankProperties.VulnerableToMines` -> `TankProperties.InvulnerableToMines`
- The modding API has moved away from singletons and now has different modded data per ModTank, ModShell, and ModBlock, so code does not execute on every entity of a given type at once
- Virtual methods no longer have a parameter for what they are modding, and now have a property (i.e: `ModTank.AITank`, `ModBlock.Block`, `ModShell.Shell`)
- `MainMenu` -> `MainMenuUI`
- `GameSceneRenderer` -> `GameScene`

## Fixes

- Pause UI now appears over everything
- Citrine Tank Music now is prioritized over Ruby
- Optimized various mathematical operations around the code
- Optimized branching and code execution all around the game, so the game should run ~10% better
- Level editor now properly displays the correct mission name on the info bar
- Fixed crash involving deleting the first mission of a campaign
- Enabling "Lantern Mode" no longer makes the main menu blur go away
- Resolution is only changed upon leaving the settings menu if you are *not* in full screen, fixing the black screen bug
- Fixed the mission intermission screen having "overlap" while fading in and out
- Fixed game not properly retrieving hardware information
- Fixed the "Hit!" graphic not being the correct color on all clients in multiplayer
- The results screen now shows the cumulative effort of all players in mutliplayer

## TODO

- [ ] New AI tank aggression system (depending on the tank type, will either make advances towards you or will avoid you)

PLEASE, if you find anything wrong, go to my [discord](https://discord.gg/KhfzvbrrKx) server and report bugs in the #bugs 
channel, or, if you want to suggest something, suggest them in the #suggestions channel.

Happy tanking!
