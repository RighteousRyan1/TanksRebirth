Remember you can enable speedrun mode with `F1`! Top 5 uploaded (may be changed later) speedruns will get their spot on the main menu!

# Additions

- You can now switch individually between Windowed, Fullscreen, and Borderless Fullscreen in the graphics settings
- Added an "Auto-Orient Tanks" option to the level editor so tanks can be oriented identically to how they were in the original game
- Added coordinates display above the mouse in the level editor
- Added network metrics (ping, packet loss, packets sent/received) to the top of a multiplayer session
- Added more particle effects in various areas of the game

# Changes

- AI Tanks are now completely overhauled! They now behave much different from how they did before
	- They almost never kill themselves
	- Almost never shoot themselves
	- Act 10x more similar to the original game
	- Should, overall, make them less of a nuisance to destroy
	- Should also improve their movements a ton
- Leveling now has decay (leveling up now takes more XP for each level) (MAYBED SAHDSHAJKD HJSKAHD JKSAHJKSD AHJKSAD HJKSDA HJKA SD)
- Reworked Co-op spawn positions on most Vanilla campaign levels
- Yellow tank music is now prioritized over the pink tank's
- Reworked a few missions, and buffed the final mission slightly
- Slightly changed the look of the "vanish" animation of invisible tanks
- Slightly adjusted the orthographic camera
- Bullets how have much more generous hitboxes (same-ish as the original, now)
- Reverted third-person smoke particles to normal
- The main menu logo no longer follows your mouse off-screen
- Slightly changed the appearance of the path created to the mouse

# Changes Important for Modders

	- Be sure to read the documentation of them by hovering on them in your IDE
- Pink tanks, internally, are now listed before Yellow tanks
	- Update any campaigns!

# Fixes

- Fixed needing a "Starting Lives" value to save a specific mission
- Changed some inconsistencies between the original missions and Rebirth's
- Fixed some particles not being oriented properly
- Pings no longer track dead tanks
- Campaign tooltips now display proper extra-lives count
- (Potentially) fixed linux systems not being able to exit campaigns after success or failure
- Fixed visual stuttering on AI controlled tanks when their rotation changes when facing down
- Fixed a bug where exiting the level editor and playing a campaign denied the player any score
- Fixed the difficulty algorithm not updating when switching levels in the level editor
- Optimizations to the particle system (~400% faster, but still has issues)
- Fixed some elements of the intermission animation being improperly scaled with resolution
