Hello! This is quite a big "minor" update. This update is jam-packed with cool new things, such as an entirely re-programmed AI tank system and
new AI tank behaviors, lots of performance enhancements, bug fixes, and more!

Starting from this point on, I will be uploading a debug-enabled binary of the game for modders to use (windows only for now, others will need to compile)

Remember you can enable speedrun mode with `F1`! Top 5 uploaded speedruns will get their spot on the main menu!

# Additions

- You can now switch individually between Windowed, Fullscreen, and Borderless Fullscreen in the graphics settings
- Added an "Auto-Orient Tanks" option to the level editor so tanks can be oriented identically to how they were in the original game
- Added coordinates display above the mouse in the level editor
- Added network metrics (ping, packet loss, packets sent/received) to the top of a multiplayer session
- Added more particle effects in various areas of the game

# Changes

- AI Tanks are now completely overhauled! They now behave much different from how they did before
	- They almost never kill themselves
	- Almost never shoot themselves
	- Act 10x more similar to the original game
	- Should, overall, make them less of a nuisance to destroy
	- Should also improve their movements a ton
- The ping menu is now located on the right of the screen, and is vertically aligned
	- Pinging is now much simpler, using your scroll wheel to determine which one to use
	- Now, you press middle click to use the highlighted ping selection
- Slightly changed the position and look of the bullet count display
- Lantern mode has now been touched up, and now shows the lanterns of each player, and looks visually different
	- Also allows the player to see very slightly in the darkness if they squint
- Reworked Co-op spawn positions on most Vanilla campaign levels
- Yellow tank music is now prioritized over the pink tank's
- Reworked a few missions, and buffed the final mission slightly
- Slightly changed the look of the "vanish" animation of invisible tanks
- Slightly adjusted the orthographic camera
- Bullets how have much more generous hitboxes (same-ish as the original, now)
- Reverted third-person smoke particles to normal
- The main menu logo no longer follows your mouse off-screen
- Slightly changed the appearance of the path created to the mouse

# Changes Important for Modders

- Completely overhauled the AI Parameters.
	- Be sure to read the documentation of them by hovering on them in your IDE
- Pink tanks, internally, are now listed before Yellow tanks
	- Update any campaigns!
- The center of the game scene is now (0, 0) instead of being slightly biased to the top
- You can now compile mods on versions higher than .NET 8.0
- `TankRotation` -> `ChassisRotation`
- `TargetXRotation` -> `DesiredXRotation`
- `Tank.Dead` -> `Tank.IsDestroyed`
- `Tank.IsIngame` has been removed
- All `DrawUtils` methods now use `String` instead of `Text`
- `DrawUtils.DrawBorderedStringWithShadow` -> `DrawUtils.DrawStringWithShadowAndBorder`

# Fixes

- Fixed needing a "Starting Lives" value to save a specific mission
- Changed some inconsistencies between the original missions and Rebirth's
- Fixed some particles not being oriented properly
- Pings no longer track dead tanks
- Campaign tooltips now display proper extra-lives count
- (Potentially) fixed linux systems not being able to exit campaigns after success or failure
- Fixed visual stuttering on AI controlled tanks when their rotation changes when facing down
- Fixed a bug where exiting the level editor and playing a campaign denied the player any score
- Fixed the difficulty algorithm not updating when switching levels in the level editor
- Optimizations to the particle system (~400% faster, but still has issues)
- Fixed some elements of the intermission animation being improperly scaled with resolution

# TODO

- [ ] Multithreaded tank AI
- [ ] Campaign fail/success display
- [ ] Tank tread hyper-optimization (and visual re-haul)
- [ ] Wiimote support
- [ ] Real-time multiplayer stats
- [ ] Fix campaigns not ending immediately on all clients

PLEASE, if you find anything wrong, go to my [discord](https://discord.gg/KhfzvbrrKx) server and report bugs in the #bugs

Happy tanking!
