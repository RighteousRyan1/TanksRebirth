# Tanks Rebirth
A complete rebuild of Wii Play's Tanks game mode. Attempting to stay true to the original game.

Have fun shooting around in this arcade shooter where you attempt to take on the world with your small, blue tank.

Includes (but is not limited to):

- All of the original game's features
- A level editor
- Online multiplayer
- Built-in modding API
- Bigger and better tanks

I decided to re-create this tanks game from the game "Wii Play" because it was a fun yet very simple game from the Wii. It had very friendly and appealing graphics, and for some reason
I felt the compulsion to recreate it- not only for myself, but for others. This project has been going on for what is about to be 4 years, this coming halloween. I've spent a lot of my free time developing this game and I hope you all enjoy
it as much as I do!
